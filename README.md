## Getting Started: Running Locally with VS Code

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 1. Open the Project in VS Code

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`View` > `Terminal` or `Ctrl+\``) and run the following command to install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server. The server will watch for file changes and automatically reload the application.
